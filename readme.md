## Description

The Weather App provides users with two main functionalities: 

1. **Your Weather**: Displays the current weather information based on the user's geolocation. Users are prompted to grant location access to obtain accurate weather details.

2. **Search Weather**: Allows users to manually search for weather information in a specific city. Users can input the city name, and the application fetches the weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The application features a tab system for easy navigation between the two functionalities and provides a visually appealing representation of weather details, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.
